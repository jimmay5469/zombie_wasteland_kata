#Welcome to the Zombie Apocalypse!

Your job is to survive. You can do this by avoiding zombies and navigating
the horrific zombie infested wasteland to the safe house as quickly as possible.

### Sample Map:

```
@*^^^
zz*z.
**...
^..*z
zz*zS
```

### Map Key:

```
  @ = Survivor start
  S = The Safe house

  Movement Cost for Terrain:
    Non-walkable:
      N/A = Zombie Infestation Area (z)
    Walkable:
      1 = Flatlands (. or @ or S)
      2 = Forest (*)
      3 = Mountain (^)
```

### Best Solution:

```
##^^^
zz#z.
**.#.
^..#z
zz*z#
```
